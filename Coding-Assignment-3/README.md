On wizarding currency
---------------------
The wizarding currency of Great Britain consisted of three different coins;  
in decreasing order of value, they were: Galleon, Sickle, and Knut. 
They were gold, silver, and bronze, respectively. There were 17 Sickles in a Galleon, 
and 29 Knuts in a Sickle, meaning there were 493 Knuts in a Galleon.  
While exchanging to muggle (real world) money one Galleon is about 5 GBP.
