Create application for managing a database of students.

Each student has unique ID, Name and Age.
Students are catalogued in one table in MySQL database.

Build an architecture that:
-The model package may only contain classes that have data members (properties).
-The dao package contains classes that are responsible for persisting data.
-The controller package contains classes that orchestrate the program.
-The view package contains classes that interact with the user.
